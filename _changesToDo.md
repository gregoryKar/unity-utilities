-       possibly priority quque that sorts items by value when you put them in and 
    for check if pass you dont need to check each one every frame.. you have them sorted 
    and just handle untill not time passed like 10 instead of 150


## <!-- [SOLVED] [REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION] -->
-       invo manager killAll doesnt look if is empty the one you give it .. check and 
    add warning if he does it .. ..
-       invo advaned constructors to return the class so that you can handle it 
    in the normal ones does it ???
-       need function to say havePassedFromThen
